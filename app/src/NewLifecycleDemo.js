      <h1>New Lifecycle Methods</h1>
      <div className="demo-body">
        <p>
          Last year I wrote an article about <a
          href="https://jarombek.com/blog/jan-19-2019-react-lifecycles">lifecycle
          methods in React</a>. It turns out my article was outdated upon arrival, since the
          React team began a multi-year process of deprecating existing lifecycles and adding
          new ones. In React 16.3, two new lifecycle methods were introduced -
          <code>getDerivedStateFromProps()</code> and <code>getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was also announced that three lifecycle methods will be slowly phased out over the
          coming releases. In React 17 (still not released at the time I'm writing this - Jan.
          17th, 2020) <code>componentWillMount</code>, <code>componentWillReceiveProps</code>,
          and <code>componentWillUpdate</code> will be removed. Legacy code can simply rename
          these methods to <code>UNSAFE_componentWillMount</code>,
          <code>UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps</code>, and
          <code>UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate</code> instead of being refactored. These
          <code>UNSAFE</code> prefixed methods were introduced in React 16.3 in case developers
          want to rename existing methods before React 17 is released.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my opinion there were some confusing aspects to some of these deprecated lifecycle
          methods. For example, <code>componentWillMount()</code> is invoked before
          <code>componentDidMount()</code>. However, API calls should occur in
          <code>componentDidMount()</code>, going against conventional logic that API calls
          should be initialized as soon as possible<sup>8</sup>. Hopefully removing these
          lifecycle methods will help simplify things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once React 17 is released, the class component lifecycles will be:
        </p>
        <p>
          <code className="code-listing">constructor()</code> (Included although technically not
          a lifecycle method)
        </p>
        <p>
          <code className="code-listing">getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state)</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          <code className="code-listing">render()</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          <code className="code-listing">componentDidMount()</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          <code className="code-listing">shouldComponentUpdate()</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          <code className="code-listing">getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState)</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          <code className="code-listing">
            componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot)
          </code>
        </p>
        <p>
          <code className="code-listing">componentWillUnmount()</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          <code className="code-listing">getDerivedStateFromError(error)</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          <code className="code-listing">componentDidCatch(error, info)</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that <code>componentDidCatch()</code> was released in React 16.0 and
          <code>getDerivedStateFromError()</code> in React 16.6. Let's take a look at
          <code>getDerivedStateFromProps()</code> and <code>getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()</code>
          specifically since they were released with React 16.3.
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>getDerivedStateFromProps()</code> replaces the soon to be deprecated
          <code>componentWillReceiveProps()</code> lifecycle method. The main difference
          between the two is that <code>componentWillReceiveProps()</code> allows for side
          effects while <code>getDerivedStateFromProps()</code> does not<sup>9</sup>. What this
          means is that <code>getDerivedStateFromProps()</code> does not have access to the
          component instance while <code>componentWillReceiveProps()</code> does<sup>10</sup>.
          This is due to <code>getDerivedStateFromProps()</code> being a static method. The
          React team made this change because providing developers access to the component
          instance in <code>componentWillReceiveProps()</code> led to code that didn't match the
          lifecycle methods intended use.
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>getDerivedStateFromProps()</code> is invoked before a component renders. Based
          on the methods name, its main purpose is to update the state, which is derived from
          the props.
