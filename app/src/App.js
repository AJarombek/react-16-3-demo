  const contextNote =
    <>
      In React 16.3, the Context API was rewritten. Context allows data to be shared amongst
      components without passing it via props from parents to children<sup>1</sup>. While I'm
      still learning which scenarios are appropriate for the context API, the React blog
      recommends to use it for "global" data used by a tree of React components<sup>2</sup>.
    </>;

  const createRefNote =
    <>
      Refs are a feature I've known about and used since I first learned React.  Refs provide a way
      to access a DOM node and use the DOM API.  React is well known for its virtual DOM, a layer of
      abstraction on top of the DOM.  Usually we interact with the virtual DOM in a declarative
      way, however Refs allow us to write traditional imperative DOM API code.  React 16.3
      introduced a new way to create Refs with the <code>createRef()</code> method.
    </>;

  const forwardRefNote =
    <>
      Ref Forwarding is when refs are passed through a component to a React element.
      Passing refs through props does not work, so special logic is needed.  If you try to
      pass a ref as a prop, it will be bound to the component instead of the underlying DOM node.
      React 16.3 introduced ref forwarding, which allows refs to be forwarded through a component to
      an underlying DOM node.

  const newLifecyclesNote =
    <>
      Last year I wrote an article about <a
      href="https://jarombek.com/blog/jan-19-2019-react-lifecycles">lifecycle methods in
      React</a>.  It turns out my article was outdated upon arrival, since the React team began a
      multi-year process of deprecating existing lifecycles and adding new ones.  In React 16.3, two
      new lifecycle methods were introduced - <code>getDerivedStateFromProps()</code> and
      <code>getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()</code>.
    </>;

  const strictModeNote =
    <>
      <code>StrictMode</code> is a new component added in React 16.3.  <code>StrictMode</code> does
      not render anything in the DOM, instead displaying additional console warnings for unsafe
      code.  Most of these relate to deprecated feature usage<sup>13</sup>.
    </>;
